Project Proposal
================
11/10/2021

### Group members:

Yushan Wang(yw3772), Jing Lyu(jl6049), Yiqun Jin(yj2686), Mengfan
Luo(ml4701)

### Tentative project title:

Smoking in NYC

### Motivation for project and intended final products:

Plan A: Public concern over the use of cigarettes had lasted for years,
as many believed that smoking contributes to air pollution and is
detrimental to other peopleâ€™s health. We would like to investigate the
density of smoking in each borough in NYC, and explore the relationship
between air quality and cigarette use in New York City. We would then
proceed to analyse which particle in air pollution are contributed most
by smoking. We will also give an overlook of the amount of smokers in
each borough, and categories of the smokers (light smokers, heavy
smokers, etc). In addition, we are also thinking to explore the
confounder in this correlation.

Plan B: mental health and smoke,

social behavior and smoke,

Insurance/health coverage and smoke,

smoke and mood

### Anticipated data sources

-   Community Health Survey Public Use Data -
    <https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/data-sets/community-health-survey-public-use-data.page>

-   Facts about cigarette -
    <https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/12481#1> (only facts, no
    data)

-   Smoking rate by borough -
    <https://nycsmokefree.org/resources/smoking-statistics/> (need to
    compile into csv or excel)

-   NYC air quality -
    <https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Air-Quality/c3uy-2p5r>

### The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

-   Analyses:

Analyse the pollution level with respect to smoking rate in that
borough;

Analyse the survey for smokers, connecting the result to air pollution.

Analyse which particle in air pollution are contributed most by smoking.

-   Visualizations:

Mapping of cigarette use in NYC;

Relationship between air quality and smoking;

Plot the amount of different kinds of smoker with respect to borough.

-   Coding challenges:

Difficulty of cleaning dataset and extract desired content from a
survey;

Unmatched variable names in each year dataset.

### Anticipated Timeline:

-   November 11: Create project proposal and github repository
-   November 12-19: Finalized project goal, datasets, divide
    responsibilities for each member
-   November 20-26: Data cleaning and data visualization
-   November 27- December 3: Data analyses and analysis report
-   December 4-10: Finalize everything, create website
-   December 11: Final project due
