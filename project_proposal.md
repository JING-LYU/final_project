11/10/2021

### Group members:

Yushan Wang(yw3772), Jing Lyu(jl6049), Yiqun Jin(yj2686), Mengfan
Luo(ml4701)

### Tentative project title:

Smoking in NYC

### Motivation for project and intended final products:

Plan A (unable to get geographical information):

Public concern over the use of cigarettes had lasted for years, as many
believed that smoking contributes to air pollution and is detrimental to
other people’s health. We would like to investigate the density of
smoking in each borough in NYC, and explore the relationship between air
quality and cigarette use in New York City. We would then proceed to
analyse which particle in air pollution are contributed most by smoking.
We will also give an overlook of the amount of smokers in each borough,
and categories of the smokers (light smokers, heavy smokers, etc). In
addition, we are also thinking to explore the confounder in this
correlation.

Plan B:

We are interested in exploring the correlation between access to health
coverage/resources and smoking. We will also investigate on confounder
that contributes to this correlation.

Aspects:

1.  Self-awareness - has insurance, time length of no insurance, told
    doctor not accepting insurance, where go when sick or need
    advice(also related with good/bad resources)

2.  Able to get health resources - “want but didn’t get needed care”.

### Anticipated data sources

-   Community Health Survey Public Use Data -
    <https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/data-sets/community-health-survey-public-use-data.page>

-   Facts about cigarette -
    <https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/12481#1> (only facts, no
    data)

-   Smoking rate by borough -
    <https://nycsmokefree.org/resources/smoking-statistics/> (need to
    compile into csv or excel)

-   Primary Care Access and Planning - Health Insurance Enrollment -
    <https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Primary-Care-Access-and-Planning-Health-Insurance-/gfej-by6h>

### The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

-   Analyses:

Analyse relationship between access to health resources and smoking;

Analyse confounder/biases that contributes the correlation.

-   Visualizations:

Mapping of health center in NYC

Relationship between access to health resources and smoking;

-   Coding challenges:

Difficulty of cleaning dataset and extract desired content from a
survey;

Unmatched variable names in each year dataset.

### Anticipated Timeline:

-   November 11: Create project proposal and github repository
-   November 12-19: Finalized project goal, datasets, divide
    responsibilities for each member
-   November 20-26: Data cleaning and data visualization
-   November 27- December 3: Data analyses and analysis report
-   December 4-10: Finalize everything, create website
-   December 11: Final project due
