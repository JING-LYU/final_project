### Variables and insurance {.tabset}

#### Smoking

##### Plot

```{r message=FALSE}
analyse_smoke_insurancetype = 
  dataset_basic %>%
  drop_na(smoker,insure) %>% 
  group_by(smoker,insure) %>% 
  summarize(n = n())

```

##### Chi-quare test  between insurance type and smoking

$H_0$ : insurance type and smoking are independent, there is no relationship between the two categorical variables. 

$H_1$ : insurance type and smoking are dependent, there is a relationship between the two categorical variables. 

*Test result:*

```{r}
#test_data_smoke_insurancetype = analyse_smoke_insurancetype %>% 
#  pivot_wider(
#  names_from = "insure", 
#  values_from = "n")

#test_data_smoke_insurancetype %>% knitr::kable()
#chisq.test(test_data_smoke_insurancetype[-1])

dat = 
  dataset_basic %>%
  drop_na(smoker,insure) 

# plot
ggbarstats(
  data = dat,
  x = smoker,
  y = insure
) +
  labs(caption = NULL) # remove caption


mosaic(~ smoker + insure,
  direction = c("v", "h"),
  data = dat,
  shade = TRUE
)
```



#### Age
##### Plot

```{r message=FALSE}
analyse_gagegroup_insurancetype = 
  dataset_basic %>%
  drop_na(agegroup,insure) %>% 
  group_by(insure,agegroup) %>% 
  summarize(n = n())

  ggplot(aes(x = agegroup, y = n, fill = insure  )) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",position = "dodge") +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = .5, hjust = 1)
  ) +
    labs(
      x = 'agegroup',
      y = 'counts',
      title = 'The distribution of insurance type in differnt agegroup')
```

##### Chi-quare test  between insurance type and health status

$H_0$ : insurance type and agegroup are independent, there is no relationship between the two categorical variables. 

$H_1$ : insurance type and agegroup are dependent, there is a relationship between the two categorical variables. 

*Test result:*

```{r}
#test_data_smoke_insurancetype = analyse_smoke_insurancetype %>% 
#  pivot_wider(
#  names_from = "insure", 
#  values_from = "n")

#test_data_smoke_insurancetype %>% knitr::kable()
#chisq.test(test_data_smoke_insurancetype[-1])

dat = 
  dataset_basic %>%
  drop_na(agegroup,insure) 
  





# fourth method:
dat %$%
  ctable(agegroup, insure,
    prop = "r", chisq = TRUE, headings = FALSE
  ) %>%
  print(
    method = "render",
    style = "rmarkdown",
    footnote = NA
  )



mosaic(~ agegroup + insure,
  direction = c("v", "h"),
  data = dat,
  shade = TRUE

#### Have children or not
##### Plot
```{r message=FALSE}
analyse_children_insurancetype = 
  dataset_basic %>%
  drop_na(children,insure)  %>% 
  group_by(insure,children) %>% 
  summarize(n = n())
  
analyse_children_insurancetype %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = children, y = n, fill = insure )) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",position = "dodge") +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = .5, hjust = 1)
  ) +
    labs(
      x = 'children',
      y = 'counts',
      title = 'The distribution of insurance type in groups of people with or without children')
```


##### Chi-quare test  between insurance type and sick advice place

$H_0$ : insurance type and have children or not are independent, there is no relationship between the two categorical variables. 

$H_1$ : insurance type and have children or not are dependent, there is a relationship between the two categorical variables. 

*Test result:*

```{r}
#test_data_smoke_insurancetype = analyse_smoke_insurancetype %>% 
#  pivot_wider(
#  names_from = "insure", 
#  values_from = "n")

#test_data_smoke_insurancetype %>% knitr::kable()
#chisq.test(test_data_smoke_insurancetype[-1])

dat = 
  dataset_basic %>%
  drop_na(children,insure)





# fourth method:
dat %$%
  ctable(children, insure,
    prop = "r", chisq = TRUE, headings = FALSE
  ) %>%
  print(
    method = "render",
    style = "rmarkdown",
    footnote = NA
  )



mosaic(~ children + insure,
  direction = c("v", "h"),
  data = dat,
  shade = TRUE
)
```

According to above chi-square test result We reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there’s at least one helath stutus group’s proportions of insurance type is different from others at 0.05 significant level.


#### BMI
##### Plot

```{r message=FALSE}
analyse_bmi_insurancetype = 
  dataset_basic %>%
  drop_na(bmi,insure) %>% 
  
  
analyse_bmi_insurancetype %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = bmi, y = n, fill = insure  )) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",position = "dodge") +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = .5, hjust = 1)
  ) +
    labs(
      x = 'medical care accessibility',
      y = 'counts',
      title = 'The distribution of insurance type in different  group of medical care accessibility')
```

##### ANOVA test  between insurance type and medical care accessibility

$H_0$ : insurance type and bmi are independent, there is no relationship between the two categorical variables. 

$H_1$ : insurance type and medical care accessibility are dependent, there is a relationship between the two categorical variables. 

*Test result:*
```{r}

```
