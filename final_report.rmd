## Motivation

We notice that a lot of smokers complain about their insurance charges. In fact, it is known that the health insurance companies stratify smokers and non-smokers and assign different insurance prices according to smoking status. 

Since health insurance is vital for peopleâ€™s well-being, and the cost is the main reason that stops people from buying insurance, we are interested in exploring the relationship between smoking and health insurance. To be specific, our research topic can be divided into three research questions. We would like to investigate:

* If smokers tend to get insurance; 
* What type of insurance they prefer; 
* Factors that affect insurance purchasing and premiums. 

Another reason that limits access to insurance is lack of information. As such, mapping of health consulting centers, health insurance carriers locations, and medicaid provider location in NYC, along with their contact information and operation hours, are also provided for readers who need more information for insurance and health advice.

<br>


## Related work 

The [Health Market website](https://www.healthmarkets.com/content/smoking-and-health-insurance) introduced the idea of **tobacco rating**. Tobacco rating is the practice of charging tobacco users more for health insurance. In fact, the charge for smokers can be up to 50% more than non-smokers, which lead us to consider if smokers would be frustrated to purchase insurance. 

In addition, there are many tweets on twitter that discuss the relationship between smoking and health insurance. We have read that smokers lose access to many health resources due to higher cost of insurance, and insurance won't approve as many treatments for smokers as non-smokers.

These facts inspired us to look deep into the relationship between smoking and health insurance.

<br>


## Initial questions

We divide our main research topic, the relationship between smoking and health insurance, into two parts: 

* Smoker insurance preferences: If smokers tend to get insurance and what type of insurance they prefer
* Insurance charges prediction: personal factors that affect insurance purchasing and premiums. 

In the first part, insurance preferences, we first explore people's insurance preferences and their smoking status in order to investigate if there is potential association between smoking and insurance. We also investigate some other variables that could be potential confounders or interaction factors between the relationship of smoking and insurance.

The second part, Insurance charges, assists our main research topic, since we can use the factors (age, bmi, smoker, etc) to not only explain what kind of personal characteristics would affect insurance cost, but also build a prediction model for health insurance charges. By doing such, we would gain better insights to the underlying relationship between health insurance and smoking, along with other important variables that contributes to the cost variation of insurance.

## Data


### Data source

#### Datasets for analysis

* [Community Health Survey Public Use Data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/data-sets/community-health-survey-public-use-data.page). This dataset contains survey questions regarding smoking and health insurance. We extracted related questions from the survey for analysis.

* [Medical Cost Personal Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance). This dataset sheds lights on insurance charges for different personal characteristics, such as smoking, age, bmi, region, etc.

#### Datasets for mapping

* [Primary Care Access and Planning - Health Insurance Enrollment](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Primary-Care-Access-and-Planning-Health-Insurance-/gfej-by6h). This dataset is used for mapping of health consulting centers in NYC. 

* [Medicaid Enrolled Provider Listing](https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Medicaid-Enrolled-Provider-Listing/keti-qx5t): This dataset is used for mapping of Medicaid provide locations in NYC.

* In addition, locations of major health insurance carriers in NYC is collected manually and used to create interactive mapping of these carriers.

### Data cleaning

For **Medical Cost Personal Dataset**, we mutate some continuous variables into factor variables

```{r, clean insurance cost data}
cost_df = read.csv("data/medical_cost_clean.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    sex = as.factor(sex),
    smoker = as.factor(smoker),

### 1. Knowledge about **insurance** in our dataset

- Among 2941 participants in the dataset: 2582 (88%) of them are insurance holders, while 359 (12%) of them don't have insurance cover. 

- Most of participants have employer-sponsored health insurance (38%), other types include Medicaid/Family Health+ (24%), Medicare (20%), Uninsured (9%), Self-purchase (6%), COBRA/Other (2%) and Milit/CHAMPUS/Tricare (1%). 

- Detailed introduction on each insurance type is summarized in the below table:

```{r message=FALSE}
insurehold = read_csv("data/dataset_basic.csv") %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  mutate(
  insuredgateway = factor(insuredgateway, levels = c(1,2), labels = c("yes", "no"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = insuredgateway,fill = insuredgateway))+

```


```{r }

insur_meaning <- c("Employer-sponsored health insurance is a health insurance selected and purchased by your employer and offered to eligible employees and their dependents.",
                   "Medicare is federal health insurance for people 65 or older, some younger people with disabilities, people with End-Stage Renal Disease",

### 2. Knowledge regarding **smoking** in our dataset

Here we conduct some explorations focusing on smoking information in our data. Click on each tab to see different dimensions of smoking data.

<br>

#### Smoking status {.tabset}

##### Age distribution


```{r,message=FALSE}
smokegroup_count = smoke_df %>% 
  drop_na(smoker) %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(smoker) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(
    smokegroup_count = n()) %>% 
  pull()

smoke_df %>% 
  drop_na(agegroup) %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(agegroup,smoker) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(
    age_count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(smokegroup_count = smokegroup_count,
         age_percent = age_count/smokegroup_count) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = smoker, y = age_percent, fill = agegroup)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",position = "dodge") +
    labs(
      x = 'Smoking status',
      y = 'Proportion',
      title = 'Age distribution among people in different smoking status',
      fill = "Age Group" )

```

There are a total 3652 (12%) current smokers, 6167 (21%) former smokers, and 18693 (66%) people never smoked among all the participants.  Most current smokers falls in age 25 to 64 (80%). 84% of the paticipants in age 18-24 filter have never smoked.

<br>


##### Health self-evaluation



```{r,message=FALSE}
smoke_df %>% 
  drop_na(generalhealth) %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(generalhealth,smoker) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(
    count = n())%>% 
  mutate(smokegroup_count = smokegroup_count,
         health_percent = count/smokegroup_count)%>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = smoker, y = health_percent, fill = generalhealth)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",position = "dodge") +
    labs(
      x = 'Smoking status',
      y = 'Health self-evaluation \n(% in each types of smoker)',
      title = 'Self-evaluation of health conditions among people in different smoking status\n(% in each types of smoker)',
      fill = "Health status" )
```

Compare with other groups, current smokers have lowest proportion of excellent health status(self-evaluated).

<br>


##### Poverty status

```{r,message=FALSE}
smoke_df %>% 
  drop_na(poverty_group) %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(poverty_group,smoker) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(
    count = n()
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    smokegroup_count = smokegroup_count,
    poverty_percent = count/smokegroup_count) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = smoker, y = poverty_percent, fill = poverty_group)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",position = "dodge") +
    labs(
      x = 'Smoking status',
      y = 'Poverty groups\n(% in each types of smoker)',
      title = 'Poverty groups (% in each types of smoker)',
      fill = "Poverty Group" )
```
Comparing to other groups, current smokers have the largest proportion of people who are <100% FPL, which means unsatisfactory financial status. They also have the least proportion of people who are >600 FPL, indicating atisfactory financial status.

<br>


##### BMI


```{r,message=FALSE}

smoke_df %>% 
  drop_na(bmi,smoker) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = smoker, y = bmi,fill = smoker)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  ylim(0,50)+
    labs(
      x = 'Smoking status',
      y = 'BMI (kg/m^2)',
      title = 'The distribution of bmi among people in different smoking status') 
```

There's no significant difference of participants BMI in different smoking status.


<br>

#### Current smokers {.tabset}

Next, we focus on the **current smokers** and look at there smoking intensity, frequency and cost, as well as their BMI index.

##### Smoking intensity and frequency

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
type = current_smoker %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = smoker_cat, fill = everyday))+
  geom_histogram(stat="count") +
    labs(
      x = 'Smoking intensity',
      y = 'Number of current smokers',
      title = 'Smoking intensity of current smokers')+
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
consumption = current_smoker %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = numberperdaya, fill = everyday)) + 
  geom_histogram()+
  xlim(0,30)+
  labs(
    x = "Average number of cigarattes smoked per day",
    y = "Number of current smokers",
    title = "Average number of cigarattes\nsmoked per day",
    fill = "Smoking frequency"
       )+
  theme(legend.position = "right")
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| my-chunkn1, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 8,
type + consumption
```

Most of the current smokers are light smokers. Among those light smokers, nearly half of them smoke everyday, while normal and heavy smokers are more likely to smoke everyday. Casual smokers tend to consume less cigarette than everyday smokers.


<br>

##### BMI

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
  
current_smoker %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = smoker_cat, y = bmi, fill = smoker_cat))+
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  ylim(0,50)+
  #facet_grid(.~smoker_cat,scales = "free") +
    labs(
      x = 'Smoking intensity',
      y = 'BMI (kg/m^2)',
      title = 'BMI among current smokers with different smoking intensity',
      color = "Smoking intensity")

```

For heavy smokers, their BMI are slightly higher than light smokers and normal smokers.

<br>


##### Cost on smoke

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
  
current_smoker %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = numberperdaya, y = cost20cigarettes,color = everyday))+
  geom_point(alpha = .5,size = 3) +
  xlim(0,50)+
  ylim(0,40)+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  #facet_grid(.~smoker_cat,scales = "free") +
    labs(
      x = 'Number of cigrattes consumed everyday',
      y = 'Cost of every 20 (one pack) cigrattes',
      title = 'Cost of every 20 (one pack) cigrattes\nfor number of cigrattes consumed everyday',
      color = "Smoking frequency")


```

Regardless of smoking frequency and smoking intensity, the cost of each pack of cigarette are even distributed within \$0 to \$20


<br>



### 3. Explore relationship between **insurance** and target variables
In this step, we want to explore more about the relationship between insurance and key variables, including smoking, age, have children or not and BMI. We start by plotting distribution graphs to see the pattern between each groups. And then we conduct statistical tests to evaluate the association and similarity between them.

<br>

#### Distributions {.tabset}
##### Smoking


```{r message=FALSE}
#| my-chunkn, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 10,
analyse_smoke_sum = 
  dataset_basic %>%
  drop_na(smoker,insure) %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(smoker,insure) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(insure = fct_reorder(insure,n)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(smoker) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(sum = sum(n)) %>% 
  pull()

analyse_smoke_insurancetype = dataset_basic %>%
  drop_na(smoker,insure) %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(smoker,insure) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(insure = fct_reorder(insure,n)
         ) 

analyse_smoke_insurancetype$sum = rep(analyse_smoke_sum, each = 7)

analyse_smoke_insurancetype =
  analyse_smoke_insurancetype %>% 
  mutate(
    freq = n/sum
  )

uninsure = analyse_smoke_insurancetype %>% 
  mutate(insure = ifelse(insure == "Uninsured", "Uninsured", "Insured"))
  
  

smoke_plot1 = analyse_smoke_insurancetype %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x =smoker , y = freq, fill = insure)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",position = "dodge") +
    labs(
      x = 'smoking status ',
      y = 'proportion',
      title = 'The proportion of insurance in different smoking group ',
      fill = "Insurance type")+
  theme(legend.position = "right")

smoke_plot2 = uninsure %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x =smoker , y = freq, fill = insure)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",position = "dodge") +
    labs(
      x = 'smoking status ',
      y = 'proportion',
      title = 'The proportion of insurance\nin different smoking group ',
      fill = "Insurance status")

smoke_plot2 + smoke_plot1
```

We found that, current smokers have the highest uninsured proportion comparing to other groups.

Regardless of the smoking status, most people tend to get employer insurance. For former smokers, a larger proportion of them get the medicare insurance compare to people who never smoke or currently smoke.


<br>


##### Age

```{r message=FALSE}
#| my-chunkn2, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 10,
analyse_agegroup_sum = 
  dataset_basic %>%
  drop_na(agegroup,insure) %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(agegroup,insure) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(insure = fct_reorder(insure,n)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(agegroup) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(sum = sum(n)) %>% 
  pull()

analyse_agegroup_insurancetype = dataset_basic %>%
  drop_na(agegroup,insure) %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(agegroup,insure) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(insure = fct_reorder(insure,n)
         ) 

analyse_agegroup_insurancetype$sum = rep(analyse_agegroup_sum, each = 7)

analyse_agegroup_insurancetype =
  analyse_agegroup_insurancetype %>% 
  mutate(
    freq = n/sum
  )

uninsure = analyse_agegroup_insurancetype %>% 
  mutate(insure = ifelse(insure == "Uninsured", "Uninsured", "Insuredd"))
  
  

agegroup_plot1 = analyse_agegroup_insurancetype %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = agegroup, y = freq, fill = insure  )) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",position = "dodge") +
    labs(
      x = 'agegroup',
      y = 'proportion',
      title = 'The distribution of insurance type in differnt age groups') +
  theme(legend.position = "right")

agegroup_plot2 = uninsure %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x =agegroup , y = freq, fill = insure)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",position = "dodge") +
    labs(
      x = 'agegroup',
      y = 'proportion',
      title = 'The proportion of insurance\nin different age group ',
      fill = "Insurance status")

agegroup_plot2 + agegroup_plot1
```
For person younger than 65 years old, people tend to get insurance as age increase. Specifically, for those age in the range of 25-64 years old, high proportion of them get **employer** insurance since they are in working age.

For person older than 65 years old, most of them get **Medicare** since Medicare is only provided for people above 65 years old.

##### Have children or not

```{r message=FALSE}
#| my-chunkn3, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 10,
analyse_child_sum = 
  dataset_basic %>%
  drop_na(child,insure) %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(child,insure) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(insure = fct_reorder(insure,n)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(child) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(sum = sum(n)) %>% 
  pull()

analyse_child_insurancetype = dataset_basic %>%
  drop_na(child,insure) %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(child,insure) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(insure = fct_reorder(insure,n)
         ) 

analyse_child_insurancetype$sum = rep(analyse_child_sum, each = 7)

analyse_child_insurancetype =
  analyse_child_insurancetype %>% 
  mutate(
    freq = n/sum
  )

uninsure = analyse_child_insurancetype %>% 
  mutate(insure = ifelse(insure == "Uninsured", "Uninsured", "Insured"))
  
  

child_plot1 = analyse_child_insurancetype %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = child, y = freq, fill = insure  )) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",position = "dodge") +
    labs(
      x = 'have children or not',
      y = 'proportion',
      title = 'Distribution of insurance type in groups\nof people with or without children') +
  theme(legend.position = "right")

child_plot2 = uninsure %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x =child , y = freq, fill = insure)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",position = "dodge") +

      y = 'proportion',
      title = 'Proportion of insurance in groups\nof people with or without children',
      fill = "Insurance status")

child_plot2 + child_plot1
```

We found that for those without children, a larger proportion of them get **Medicare** comparing to those with children.

##### BMI


```{r message=FALSE}
analyse_bmi_insurancetype = 
  dataset_basic %>%
  drop_na(bmi,insure) 
  
uninsure_bmi = analyse_bmi_insurancetype %>%

      y = 'bmi',
      title = 'The distribution of bmi in groups\nhaving insurance or not') +
  coord_flip()

bmi_plot2 + bmi_plot1
```

We did not observe significant difference between each group.

#### Statistical test {.tabset}

From the plots, we could find out many patterns about the relations between `insurance status` and `smoking` `age` and `have children or not`. To further validate the association between `insurance type` and other key factors as well as between `insurance status` and `BMI`.

##### Smoking

###### **Chi-quare test between insurance type and smoking**

$H_0$ : insurance type and smoking are independent, there is no relationship between the two categorical variables. 

$H_1$ : insurance type and smoking are dependent, there is a relationship between the two categorical variables. 

*Test result:*

```{r}
dat = 
  dataset_basic %>%
  drop_na(smoker,insure) 
```

```{r}
#| my-chunk1, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 8,

# plot
ggbarstats(
  data = dat,
  x = smoker,
  y = insure,
  title = "Chi-quare test between insurance type and smoking"
) +
  labs(caption = NULL) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = .5, hjust = 1)
  ) 


```

We reject $H_0$ and then conclude that insurance type and smoking are dependent.



##### Age
###### **Chi-quare test  between insurance type and age**

$H_0$ : insurance type and age are independent, there is no relationship between the two categorical variables. 

$H_1$ : insurance type and age are dependent, there is a relationship between the two categorical variables. 

*Test result:*

```{r}
dat = 
  dataset_basic %>%
  drop_na(agegroup,insure) 
```

```{r}
#| my-chunk2, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 8,
ggbarstats(
  data = dat,
  x = smoker,
  y = insure,
  title = "Chi-quare test result between insurance type and age"
) +
  labs(caption = NULL) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = .5, hjust = 1)
  ) 

```

We reject $H_0$ and then conclude that insurance type and age are dependent.

##### Have children or not
###### **Chi-quare test  between insurance type and children**

$H_0$ : insurance type and have children or not are independent, there is no relationship between the two categorical variables. 

$H_1$ : insurance type and have children or not are dependent, there is a relationship between the two categorical variables. 

*Test result:*

```{r}
#test_data_smoke_insurancetype = analyse_smoke_insurancetype %>% 
#  pivot_wider(
#  names_from = "Insured", 
#  values_from = "n")

#test_data_smoke_insurancetype %>% knitr::kable()
#chisq.test(test_data_smoke_insurancetype[-1])

dat = 
  dataset_basic %>%
  drop_na(child,insure)
```

```{r}
#| my-chunk3, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 8,

ggbarstats(
  data = dat,
  x = child,
  y = insure,
  title = "Chi-quare test between insurance type and children"
) +
  labs(caption = NULL) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = .5, hjust = 1)
  ) 
```

We reject $H_0$ and then conclude that insurance type and children are dependent.

##### BMI

###### **ANOVA test  between insurance type and BMI**

$H_0$ : The mean of BMI in each insurance type groups are the same

$H_1$ : At least two means of BMI in all insurance type groups are different

*Test result:*
```{r}
#| my-chunk62, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 10,fig.height = 8
anova = aov( bmi ~insure, data = analyse_bmi_insurancetype)
anova %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  knitr::kable()
Tukey_comp = TukeyHSD(anova)

par(mar = c(2, 18, 2, 2))
plot(Tukey_comp,las = 1,
     cex.axis = 0.8)
```

###### **ANOVA test  between insurance status and BMI**

$H_0$ : The mean of BMI in groups with or without insurance are the same

$H_1$ : The means of BMI in groups with or without insurance are different

*Test result:*
```{r}
#| my-chunk61, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 10,fig.height = 8
anova = aov( bmi ~insure, data = uninsure_bmi)
anova %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  knitr::kable()

```

According to the ANOVA test, we can not reject $H_0$  and conclude the mean of BMI in each insurance type groups are the same.

## Additional analysis

In order to assists our main research topic, the relationship between smoking and health insurance, we would like to investigate the amount of insurance price change due to smoking, along with other personal factors such age, sex, weight and whether or not having children. A **prediction model** is build to analyse this question.


### A snapshot of the vairables

We selected the following variable for modeling. Detailed information are in the table below:
```{r}
var <- c("smoker", "children_group", "sex", "age", "bmi", "charges")

var_meaning <- c("0 = non-smoker, 1 = smoker", "0 = No children, 1 = Have at least 1 child", "1 = male, 2 = female", "Age range from 18 to 63", "Body mass index range from 15.96 to 53.13", "Cost of health insurance")

var_info <- data.frame(var, var_meaning) %>% 
  dplyr::rename(
    "Variable name" = var,
    "Variable information" = var_meaning
  )
knitr::kable(var_info)
```


### Relationship between each variables and charge of insurance {.tabset}

#### Smoker and insurance charges

```{r}

cost_df_smoker = 
  cost_df %>%
  mutate(
    smoker = fct_recode(
      smoker,
      "Smoker" = "1",

cost_df_child = 
  cost_df %>%
  mutate(
    children_group = fct_recode(
      children_group,
      "Having at least one child" = "1",
      "No children" = "0"
      ))
    
child_plotly <- cost_df_child %>% 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~children_group,
    y = ~charges,
    split = ~children_group,

    yaxis = list(
      title = "Insurance charges",
      zeroline = F
    ),
    legend=list(title=list(text='<b> Whether or not having children </b>'))

<br>

#### Gender and insurance charges

```{r}
cost_df_sex = 
  cost_df %>%
  mutate(
    sex = fct_recode(
      sex,
      "Male" = "1",
      "Female" = "2"
      ))
    
sex_plotly <- cost_df_sex %>%

<br>

#### Age and insurance charges

```{r}
age_fit <- lm(charges ~ age, data = cost_df)


age_plotly <- plot_ly(
  cost_df, 
  x = ~age, 
  y = ~charges,

  ) %>% 
  add_markers(y = ~charges) %>% 
  add_lines(x = ~bmi, y = fitted(bmi_fit), color = "") %>% 
  layout(showlegend = FALSE)


bmi_plotly
```

<br>

###

From the five plots above, we can tell that smoking, age, and bmi significantly affect charge of insurance. The relationship between charges and gender or having children is unclear. Further analysis will be carried below to illustrate their relationships.



### Model selection

#### Correlation plot

```{r}

cost_df_cor = cost_df %>% 
  dplyr::select(age, sex, bmi, smoker, charges, children_group)

model.matrix(~0+., data = cost_df_cor) %>% 
  cor(use="pairwise.complete.obs") %>% 
  ggcorrplot(show.diag = F, type="lower", lab=TRUE, lab_size=2)

```

There is no collinearity between any of the variables. Therefore, no need to adjust variable for model building. In addition, smoking seems to be the highest correlated variable to charges among other variables.



**Fit regression using all predictors**

```{r}
model <- lm(charges ~ smoker + children_group + sex + age + bmi, data = cost_df)
summary(model)%>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

The model building result shows that sex is not a significant variable with p-value < 0.05. Therefore, when we do the stepwise regression, we would likely to remove the variable of sex.


#### Stepwise regression

```{r, results="hide"}
step = step(model, direction='both')
```

```{r}
summary(step)%>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  knitr::kable()

```

The stepwise regression process confirms that sex is not significant variable. Therefore we remove sex variable and retain all other variables for prediction model.

#### Final model with significant variables

```{r}
model1 <- lm(charges ~ smoker + children_group + age + bmi, data = cost_df)
summary(model1) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```



### Model diagnostic
```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(model1)
```

The graph above did not show homoscedasticity of residual. Therefore, we need to transform the model.



### Model transformation

#### Box-Cox Transformation

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 3.5}

par(mfrow = c(1,2))

boxcox(model1, lambda = seq(-3, 3, by = 0.25)) 

plot(model1, which = 4) # remove 544, 578, 1301

```

```{r}

cost_df_out = cost_df[-c(544,578, 1301),]

```


Since lamda = 0, try natural log transformation.

**Before transformation, remove outliers first**

The outliers are rows 544, 578, 1301. Following model building will use dataset without these outliers.





**Transform charges to ln(charges)**

```{r}

#summary(cost_df_out)
cost_df_log = cost_df_out %>% 
  mutate(
    Lncharges = log(charges)
  ) 

# fit multivariate model with log transform
model_log = lm(Lncharges ~ smoker + children_group + age + bmi, data = cost_df_log) 
summary(model_log) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  knitr::kable()

```

Above table shows the estimates for each variables when charges is transformed to In(charges).



#### Diagnostic for transformed model



```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 3.5}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))

boxcox(model_log)

plot(model_log, which = 1)
```



Lamda is near 1 now, and the residual distribution improved from un-transformed data. We conclude this model is acceptable.

<br>



### Final model

```{r}
summary(model_log) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```



#### Decode the model estimates

Holding all other variable fixed, smoking is associated with a 155% increase in insurance charges than non-smokers. Being older, higher body mass index, and having at least 1 children also increase insurance charges.

### Shiny dashboard for predicting insurance charge

The [Shiny dashboard](https://yiqunjin.shinyapps.io/shiny_dashboard/) is a visualization of the prediction of insurance premium. By providing the information of age, BMI, smoke or not smoke, with or without children, user could get a general idea of the range of insurance premium.

## Additional visualization {.tabset}

In order to provide reader who are seeking help for signing up insurance and getting advice about health insurance, we provide several maps of health insurance related agencies with location and contact information. Click on the icons on the maps for detailed information.

### Health center location mapping

For general public seeking assistance with signing up for health insurance or SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), here is a mapping of health center locations, where health insurance enrollment and assistance with SNAP benefits (Food Stamps) are offered.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
health_center = read.csv("data/health_center.csv") %>%

### Medicaid location mapping

Medicaid provides health coverage to low-income people, including eligible low-income adults, children, pregnant women, elderly adults and people with disabilities. Medicaid is one of the largest payers for health care in the United States and is administered by states, according to federal requirements. The program is funded jointly by states and the federal government.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
medicaid_provider = GET("https://health.data.ny.gov/resource/keti-qx5t.csv",
                        query = list("$limit" = 10000)) %>% 
  content("parsed")

medicaid = medicaid_provider %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  #drop_na() %>% 
  filter(state == "NY") %>% 
  filter(city %in% c("NEW YORK", "FLUSHING", "BRONX", "BROOKLYN", "STATEN ISLAND")) %>%

## Discussion

1. Do smoker tend to get insurance?

No. The uninsured rate for current smokers is 44.4% higher than people who currently do not smoke.

2. What type of insurance do people tend to get?

For person younger than 65 years old, people tend to get insurance as age increase. Specifically, for those age in the range of 25-64 years old, high proportion of them get employer insurance since they are in working age.

For person older than 65 years old, most of them get Medicare since Medicare is only provided for people above 65 years old.

3. How does personal factors(age, having children, smoking, bmi) affect insurance purchasing and premiums?

During exploration stage, we found that smoker have lower insured rate than non-smokers. Moreover, smokers tend to have more unsatisfactory financial status compare to non-smokers. Being in poor financial status may prevent people from spending on insurance. We also found that as people age increase, the proportion of people holding insurance also increase. In addition, people who have at least one child have higher insured rate compare to people who do not have children. We could not found association between bmi and insurance from this survey.

During the prediction model building process, we found that when holding all other variable fixed, smoking is associated with a 155% increase in insurance charges than non-smokers. In addition, being older, higher body mass index, and having at least 1 children also increase insurance premiums. 

4. Future progression

For people older than 65, they will have access to medicare insurance, which is significantly cheaper than private/self-purchased insurance. Since our prediction model is focused on private insurance, we suggest people older than 65 years old to be mindful when using our prediction interactive page.


For future analysis of relationship between smoking and health insurance, we would like to stratify states in the U.S. in order to eliminate the bias caused by policies, economy, and social behavior.
