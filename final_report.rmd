## Motivation

It is known that the health insurance companies stratify smokers and non-smokers and assign different insurance prices according to smoking status. Intuitively, we think that as price increase, the smoker would less likely to purchase health insurance.

Since health insurance is vital for peopleâ€™s well-being, and the cost is the main reason that stops people from buying insurance, we are interested in exploring the relationship between smoking and health insurance. To be specific, our research topic can be divided into three research questions. We would like to investigate if smokers in NYC tend to get insurance, what type of insurance they prefer, and the factors that affect insurance cost. 

Another reason that limits access to insurance is lack of information. As such, mapping of health consulting centers, health insurance carriers locations, and medicaid provider location in NYC, along with their contact information and operation hours, are also provided for readers who need more information for insurance and health advice.


## Related work 

The [Health Market website](https://www.healthmarkets.com/content/smoking-and-health-insurance) introduced the idea of **tobacco rating**. Tobacco rating is the practice of charging tobacco users more for health insurance. In fact, the charge for smokers can be up to 50% more than non-smokers, which lead us to consider if smokers would be frustrated to purchase insurance. 

In addition, there are many tweets on twitter that discuss the relationship between smoking and health insurance. We have read that smokers lose access to many health resources due to higher cost of insurance, and insurance won't approve as many treatments for smokers as non-smokers.

These facts inspired us to look deep into the relationship between smoking and health insurance.

## Initial questions

The initial questions we were trying to answer was if smokers in NYC tend to get insurance, what type of insurance they prefer. Over the course of the project, we added a new research question relating to the topic, which was the investigation of factors that affect insurance cost. 

This new question assists our main research topic, because we can use the factors (age, bmi, smoker, etc) to not only explain what kind of personal characteristics would affect insurance cost, but also build a prediction model for health insurance charges. By doing such, we would gain better insights to the underlying relationship between health insurance and smoking, along with other important variables that contributes to the cost variation of insurance.

## Data
Source, scraping method, cleaning, etc.

### Data source

#### Datasets for analysis

* [Community Health Survey Public Use Data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/data-sets/community-health-survey-public-use-data.page). This dataset contains survey questions regarding smoking and health insurance. We extracted related questions from the survey for analysis.

* [Medical Cost Personal Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance). This dataset sheds lights on insurance charges for different personal characteristics, such as smoking, age, bmi, region, etc.

#### Datasets for mapping

* [Primary Care Access and Planning - Health Insurance Enrollment](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Primary-Care-Access-and-Planning-Health-Insurance-/gfej-by6h). This dataset is used for mapping of health consulting centers in NYC. 

* [Medicaid Enrolled Provider Listing](https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Medicaid-Enrolled-Provider-Listing/keti-qx5t): This dataset is used for mapping of Medicaid provide locations in NYC.

* In addition, locations of major health insurance carriers in NYC is collected manually and used to create interactive mapping of these carriers.

### Data cleaning

For **Community Health Survey Public Use Data**, we select year 2014-2016 and variables relating to smoking, insurance, and basic health and economic status. The resulting dataset, available **here**, consists of roughly 28000 participants and includes the following 12 variables:

```



For **Medical Cost Personal Dataset**, we change character entries to numerical entries, and mutate some continuous variables into factor variables

```{r, clean insurance cost data}
cost_df = read.csv("data/insurance_medical_cost_personal_datasets.csv")

cost_df = cost_df %>% 
  mutate(
    smoker = ifelse(smoker == "yes", 1, 0),
    smoker = as.factor(smoker),
    sex = ifelse(sex == "male", 1, 2),
    sex = as.factor(sex),
    children = as.factor(children),
    children_group = ifelse(children == 0, 0, 1),
    children_group = as.factor(children_group)
     
    ) %>% 
    na.omit()

```

**This dataset includes the following variables**

* `age`: Age
* `sex`: Sex (male = 1, female = 2)
* `bmi`: Body Mass Index
* `children`: number of children the person has
* `smoker`: smoking status (non-smoker = 0, smoker = 1)
* `region`: region in th US

## Additional analysis
If you undertake formal statistical analyses, describe these in detail

In order to assists our main research topic, the relationship between smoking and health insurance, we would like to investigate the amount of insurance price change due to smoking, along with other personal factors such age, sex, weight and whether or not having children. A **prediction model** is build to analyse this question.


### A snapshot of the vairables

We selected the following variable for modeling. Detailed information are in the table below:
```{r}
var <- c("smoker", "children_group", "sex", "age", "bmi", "charges")

var_meaning <- c("0 = non-smoker, 1 = smoker", "0 = No children, 1 = Have at least 1 child", "1 = male, 2 = female", "Age range from 18 to 63", "Body mass index range from 15.96 to 53.13", "Cost of health insurance")

var_info <- data.frame(var, var_meaning) %>% 
  dplyr::rename(
    "Variable name" = var,
    "Variable information" = var_meaning
  )
knitr::kable(var_info)
```


#### Relationship between each variables and charge of insurance

```{r, fig.width=12,fig.height=15}

smoker_plot = 
  ggplot(cost_df, aes(x = smoker, y = charges, fill = smoker)) + 
  geom_violin() + 
  labs(title = "Smoker and charges") 

children_plot = 
  ggplot(cost_df, aes(x = children_group, y = charges, fill = children_group)) + 
  geom_violin() + 
  labs(title = "Having children and charges")

sex_plot = 
  ggplot(cost_df, aes(x = sex, y = charges, fill = sex)) + 
  geom_violin() + 
  labs(title = "Gender and charges")

age_smoker_plot = 
  ggplot(cost_df, aes(x = age, y = charges, color = smoker)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  labs(title = "Age and charges by smoking group")

age_childgroup_plot = 
  ggplot(cost_df, aes(x = age, y = charges, color = children_group)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  labs(title = "Age and charges by whether having children")

bmi_smoker_plot = 
  ggplot(cost_df, aes(x = bmi, y = charges, color = smoker)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) + 
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = "BMI and charges by smoking group") 

bmi_childgroup_plot = 
  ggplot(cost_df, aes(x = bmi, y = charges, color = children_group)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  labs(title = "BMI and charges by whether having children")

ggarrange(smoker_plot, children_plot, sex_plot, age_smoker_plot, 
          age_childgroup_plot, bmi_smoker_plot, bmi_childgroup_plot
          + rremove("x.text"),
          #labels = c("smoker", "children_group", "sex","age","bmi"),
          ncol = 2, nrow = 4)

```

At first glance, we can tell that smoking, age, and bmi significantly affect charge of insurance. The relationship between sex, having children and charge is unclear.


### Model selection

#### Correlation plot

```{r}

cost_df_cor = cost_df %>% 
  dplyr::select(age, sex, bmi, smoker, charges, children_group)

model.matrix(~0+., data = cost_df_cor) %>% 
  cor(use="pairwise.complete.obs") %>% 
  ggcorrplot(show.diag = F, type="lower", lab=TRUE, lab_size=2)

```

There is no collinearity between any of the variables. Therefore, no need to adjust variable for model building. In addition, smoking seems to be the highest correlated variable to charges among other variables.



**Fit regression using all predictors**

```{r}
model <- lm(charges ~ smoker + children_group + sex + age + bmi, data = cost_df)
summary(model)%>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

The model building result shows that sex is not a significant variable with p-valur > 0.05. Therefore, when we do the stepwise regression, we would likely to remove the variable of sex.


#### Stepwise regression

```{r}
step(model, direction='both')

```

The stepwise regression process confirm that sex is not significant variable.


#### Final model with significant variables

```{r}
model1 <- lm(charges ~ smoker + children_group + age + bmi, data = cost_df)
summary(model1) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```



### Model diagnostic
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(model1)
```

The graph above did not show homoscedasticity of residual. Therefore, we need to transform the model.



### Model transformation

#### Box-Cox Transformation

```{r}
boxcox(model1, lambda = seq(-3, 3, by = 0.25)) 
```

Since lamda = 0, try natural log transformation.



**Before transformation, remove outliers first**

```{r}
plot(model1, which = 4) # remove 544, 578, 1301

cost_df_out = cost_df[-c(544,578, 1301),]

```

The outliers are rows 544, 578, 1301. Following model building will use dataset without these outliers.



**Transform charges to ln(charges)**

```{r}

summary(cost_df_out)
cost_df_log = cost_df_out %>% 
  mutate(
    Lncharges = log(charges)
  ) 

# fit multivariate model with log transform
model_log = lm(Lncharges ~ smoker + children_group + age + bmi, data = cost_df_log) 
model_log
```


#### Diagnostic for transformed model

```{r}
boxcox(model_log)

par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(model_log)
```

Lamda is near 1 now, and the residual distribution improved from un-transformed data. We conclude this model is acceptable.



### Final model

```{r}
summary(model_log) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```



#### Decode the model estimates

Holding all other variable fixed, smoking is associated with a 155% increase in insurance charges than non-smokers. Being older, higher body mass index, and having at least 1 children also increase insurance charges.

### Shiny dashboard for predicting insurance charge

The [Shiny dashboard](https://yiqunjin.shinyapps.io/shiny_dashboard/) is a visualization of the prediction of insurance premium using the dataset "insurance_medical_cost_personal_datasets.csv". By providing the information of age, BMI, smoke or not smoke, with or without children, user could get a general idea of the range of insurance premium.

## Additional visualization

### Medicaid location mapping

Medicaid provides health coverage to low-income people, including eligible low-income adults, children, pregnant women, elderly adults and people with disabilities. Medicaid is one of the largest payers for health care in the United States and is administered by states, according to federal requirements. The program is funded jointly by states and the federal government.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
medicaid_provider = GET("https://health.data.ny.gov/resource/keti-qx5t.csv",

## Discussion
What were your findings? Are they what you expect? What insights into the data can you make?

During the prediction model building process, we found that when holding all other variable fixed, smoking is associated with a 155% increase in insurance charges than non-smokers. This finding confirmed the fact that smokers are charged for higher insurance. In addition, being older, higher body mass index, and having at least 1 children also increase insurance costs.
