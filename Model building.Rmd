##### Chi-quare test  between insurance type and smoking

$H_0$ : insurance type and smoking are independent, there is no relationship between the two categorical variables.

According to above chi-square test result We reject the null hypothesis and conclude that thereâ€™s at least one helath stutus groupâ€™s proportions of insurance type is different from others at 0.05 significant level.
