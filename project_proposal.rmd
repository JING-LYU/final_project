### Tentative project title:
Smoking in NYC

### Motivation for project and intended final products:

Public concern over the use of cigarettes had lasted for years, as many believed that smoking contributes to air pollution and is detrimental to other peopleâ€™s health. We want to first introduce some background about smoking facts. We are interested in exploring the relationship between air quality and cigarette use in New York City. In addition, we also want to explore the places where people like to buy cigarettes, and cigarette store locations with respect to cigarette use.


### Anticipated data sources

* Adult tobacco survey - https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Adult-Tobacco-Survey-Beginning-2003/ckfz-a669

* Facts about cigarette - https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/12481#1

* Smoking rate by borough - https://nycsmokefree.org/resources/smoking-statistics/ (need to compile into csv or excel)

* Active Retail Tobacco and Vapor Product Vendors - https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Active-Retail-Tobacco-and-Vapor-Product-Vendors/9ma3-vsuk 

* NYC air quality - https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Air-Quality/c3uy-2p5r

### The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

* Analyses:

Analyse the concentration of particle that smoking contributes with respect to smoking rate in that borough;

Connecting the analysis of air quality with public opinion about smoking outdoor;

Analyse where people like to buy cigarettes.



* Visualizations: 

Mapping of cigarette use in NYC;

Mapping of cigarette store in NYC;

Relationship between air quality and smoking;

Plots of popular places where people buy cigarettes. 


* Coding challenges: 

Difficulty of cleaning dataset and extract desired content from a survey of adult tobacco survey of New York State
