### Group members:
Yushan Wang(yw3772), Jing Lyu(jl6049), Yiqun Jin(yj2686), Mengfan Luo(ml4701)

### Tentative project title:
Smoker and their health Insurance/recources in NYC

### Motivation for project and intended final products:

We are interested in exploring the correlation between access to health coverage/resources and smoking. We will also investigate on factors that affect whether or not a person can get insurance.

Aspects:

1. Self-awareness - has insurance, time length of no insurance, told doctor not accepting insurance, where go when sick or need advice(also related with good/bad resources)...

2. Access to health resources - need but not get, not fill a prescription because of cost, can't afford...


### Anticipated data sources

Smoking and Health Insurance price: https://www.healthmarkets.com/content/smoking-and-health-insurance

* Community Health Survey Public Use Data - https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/data-sets/community-health-survey-public-use-data.page

* Facts about cigarette - https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/12481#1 (only facts, not dataset)

* Primary Care Access and Planning - Health Insurance Enrollment - https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Primary-Care-Access-and-Planning-Health-Insurance-/gfej-by6h

### The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

* Analyses:

Analyse relationship between access to health resources and smoking;

Analyse different aspects in relation with whether or not getting insurance.

(Analyse confounder/biases that contributes the correlation.)


* Visualizations: 

Mapping of health center in NYC

Will think of more visualizations during analysis (use plotly)


* Coding challenges: 

Difficulty of cleaning dataset and extract desired content from a survey;

Unmatched variable names in each year;

Different survey questions in each years - can not analyse correlation when the data are from different years.

### Anticipated Timeline:

* November 11: Create project proposal and github repository
* November 12-19: Finalized project goal, datasets, divide responsibilities for each member
* November 20-26: Data cleaning and data visualization
* November 27- December 3: Data analyses and analysis report
* December 4-10: Finalize everything, create website
* December 11: Final project due
