## Data loading and crude cleaning

We select year 2014-2016 and variables relating to smoking and insurance. 

```{r}

chs16 = read_sas("data/chs2016_public.sas7bdat")

chs16_filter = chs16 %>% 
  select(agegroup,generalhealth,insuredgateway16,insure16,insured,insure5,sickadvice16,sickplace,didntgetcare16,smoker,everyday,numberperdaya,cost20cigarettes,imputed_povertygroup ,bmi,child,sex) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2016) %>% 
  rename(insuredgateway = insuredgateway16, insure = insure16,sickadvice = sickadvice16,didntgetcare = didntgetcare16)


chs15 = read_sas("data/chs2015_public.sas7bdat")

chs15_filter = chs15 %>%

## About smoking

For `never` and `former` smokers, no data for variables `everyday`, `numberperdaya`, `cost20cigarettes`, so next we **focus on the current smokers**.


* Cost and number of daily consumption

```{r}
current_smoker = smoke_df %>% filter(smoker == "current")
```


```{r}

current_smoker %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = numberperdaya, fill = everyday)) + 
  geom_histogram(alpha = .7)+
  xlim(0,30)+
  labs(
    x = "Average number of cigarattes smoked per day",
    y = "Number of smokers"
       )+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") 

  
current_smoker %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = cost20cigarettes, fill = everyday)) + 
  geom_histogram(alpha = .7)+
  xlim(0,20)+
  labs(
    x = "Cost on each pack (20 cigarattes)",
    y = "Number of smokers"
       )
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") 
  
  
current_smoker %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = cost20cigarettes)) + 
  geom_density()


current_smoker %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = smoker_cat, y = cost20cigarettes, fill = smoker_cat))+
  geom_violin() +
    labs(
      x = 'Type of smokers',
      y = 'Cost of every 20 (one pack) cigrattes',
      title = 'Cost of every 20 (one pack) cigrattes\namong different type of smokers')
  
  
current_smoker %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = numberperdaya, y = cost20cigarettes,color = smoker_cat))+
  geom_point(alpha = .5,size = 3) +
  #facet_grid(.~smoker_cat,scales = "free") +
    labs(
      x = 'Number of cigrattes consumed everyday',
      y = 'Cost of every 20 (one pack) cigrattes',
      title = 'Cost of every 20 (one pack) cigrattes\nfor number of cigrattes consumed everyday')




```



Chi-squared test for `insure` and 

2.

```{r}
analyse_poverty_insurancetype = 
  dataset_basic %>%
  drop_na(imputed_povertygroup,insure) %>% 
  mutate(imputed_povertygroup = factor(imputed_povertygroup,levels = c(1,2,3,4,5))) %>% 
  mutate(insure = factor(insure,levels = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7),labels = c("Employer","Self-purchase","Medicare", "Medicaid/Family Health+", "Milit/CHAMPUS/Tricare", "COBRA/Other", "Uninsured"))) %>% 
  group_by(imputed_povertygroup,insure) %>% 
  summarize(n = n())
```


```{r}
test_data_poverty_insurance = analyse_poverty_insurancetype %>% 
  pivot_wider(
  names_from = "insure", 
  values_from = "n")
```

```{r}
chisq.test(test_data_poverty_insurance[-1])
