### Health center location mapping

For general public seeking assistance with signing up for health insurance or SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), here is a mapping of health center locations, where health insurance enrollment and assistance with SNAP benefits (Food Stamps) are offered.

```{r load packages, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(leaflet)
library(rvest)
library(httr)
#options(knitr.duplicate.label = "allow")

```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
health_center = read.csv("data/health_center.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() 
```


```{r leaflet mapping}
leaflet(health_center) %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.NatGeoWorldMap) %>% 
  addMarkers(lat = ~latitude, 
             lng = ~longitude, 
             popup = paste("Health Center name:", health_center$health_center, "<br>", "Street address:", health_center$street_address, "<br>", "Telephone number:", health_center$telephone_number, "<br>", "Borough:", health_center$borough),
             clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
```

<br>
**Time of operation and walk-in:**
```{r}
health_center_table = health_center %>% 
  select(health_center, street_address, telephone_number, days_of_operation, hours_of_operation, accept_walk_ins) %>% 
  mutate(
    accept_walk_ins = c(rep("Yes",11))
  ) %>% 
  relocate(
    health_center, days_of_operation, hours_of_operation, accept_walk_ins,
    street_address, telephone_number
    ) %>% 
  dplyr::rename(
    "Health Center name" = health_center,
    "Street address" = street_address,
    "Telephone number" = telephone_number,
    "Days of operation" = days_of_operation,
    "Hours of operation" = hours_of_operation,
    "Accept walk in" = accept_walk_ins
  )
  
rmarkdown::paged_table(health_center_table)
```

### Medicaid location mapping

Medicaid provides health coverage to low-income people, including eligible low-income adults, children, pregnant women, elderly adults and people with disabilities. Medicaid is one of the largest payers for health care in the United States and is administered by states, according to federal requirements. The program is funded jointly by states and the federal government.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
medicaid_provider = GET("https://health.data.ny.gov/resource/keti-qx5t.csv",
                        query = list("$limit" = 10000)) %>% 
  content("parsed")

medicaid = medicaid_provider %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  #drop_na() %>% 
  filter(state == "NY") %>% 
  filter(city %in% c("NEW YORK", "FLUSHING", "BRONX", "BROOKLYN", "STATEN ISLAND")) %>% 
  filter(county %in%  c("NEW YORK", "QUEENS", "BRONX", "BROOKLYN", "STATEN ISLAND")) %>% 
  subset(!(telephone %in% c(3155365160, 8458875530, 2129871777, 2128971994,2127723111)))

```


```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
leaflet(medicaid) %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.NatGeoWorldMap) %>% 
  addMarkers(lat = ~latitude, 
             lng = ~longitude, 
             popup = paste("Provider name:", medicaid$mmis_name, "<br>", "Street address:", medicaid$service_address, "<br>", "Telephone number:", medicaid$telephone),
             clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
```
