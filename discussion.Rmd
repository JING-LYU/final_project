## Conclusion

We found that smokers have lower insured rate; people age below 65 tend to get employer insurance while people age above 65 tend to get medicare; Smoking, being older, having higher BMI and having at least one child also increase insurance premiums.

## Future progression

For people older than 65, they will have access to medicare insurance, which is significantly cheaper than private/self-purchased insurance. Since our prediction model is focused on private insurance, we suggest people older than 65 years old to be mindful when using our prediction interactive page.

For future analysis of relationship between smoking and health insurance, we would like to stratify states in the U.S. in order to eliminate the bias caused by policies, social-economic status.
